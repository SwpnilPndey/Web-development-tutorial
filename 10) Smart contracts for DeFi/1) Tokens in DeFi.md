## What is the use of tokens in DeFi?


Companies create token, distribute them to investors and raise funds via ICO (similar to IPO) and instead of shares in company, the investors get tokens. 

Investors can benefit in a number of ways in the project ecosystem using those tokens like low cost of tokens if investors invest in presale (showing confidence in project) or subsidized access to company services and dapps or voting rights in significant decisions 

Investors can also stake their share of tokens and earn token staking reward and portion of transaction fees and this way appreciate the token value with time 

After the initial token distribution, the tokens can be traded on a variety of exchanges, including centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, as well as decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Sushiswap.

Very similar to shares, the value of tokens is volatile and driven by market forces and sentiments.

Other way people can earn company tokens is to become whitelisted user and get free tokens called AIRDROPS. Companies expand their user base in which the user needs to do some activities like liking and subscribing on social media, sending the airdrop links to others etc.

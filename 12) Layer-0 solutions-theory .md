## What is polkadot project ?

It is a platform which provides interoperability between multiple blockchains



## What is Layer 0 blockchain ?

Layer 0 is the foundation of blockchain networks and is important for keeping them secure, fast, and able to handle lots of users. 

Solutions such as Cosmos, Polkadot, and Avalanche offer a way to connect different blockchains together and enable seamless interoperability between them.

## How cosmos works ?

Cosmos network consists of a PoS blockchain mainnet called Cosmos Hub and customized blockchains known as Zones. Cosmos Hub transfers assets and data between the connected Zones and provides a shared layer of security. Cosmos uses a system called the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

## How Avalanche works ?

Avalanche uses a tri-blockchain infrastructure consisting of three core chains: the Contract Chain (C-chain), the Exchange Chain (X-chain), and the Platform Chain (P-chain)

## How Polkadot works ?

The protocol uses a main chain — called the Polkadot Relay Chain — and each independent blockchain built on Polkadot is known as a parallel chain, or parachain.

The Relay Chain functions as a bridge between parachains to enable efficient data communication.

Polkadot uses proof-of-stake (PoS) validation to ensure network security and consensus. Projects that want to build on Polkadot participate in auctions to bid for slots.

## Zksync is a L2 ethereum blockchain 

It utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) to enable fast and secure transactions,and write the results to the Layer 1 blockchain (Ethereum).

### ZkSync doesnot have a native token of its own. It uses ether and ethereum tokens. 

### So, to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens on ZK Sync network, we can make use of Zk Sync bridges

### Then we can deploy contract just like we deploy on Layer-1

## Although not launched yet, ZKS is a potential token for ZK sync network just like ARB of Arbitrum

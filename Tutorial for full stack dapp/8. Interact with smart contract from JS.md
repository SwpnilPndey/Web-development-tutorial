## Contract abstractions 

It is the entry point through which we can interact with the contract from JS

For example in truffle, we can get contract abstraction as : 

let instance = await <contract name>.deployed(); // or 
let instance = await <contract name>.new({ from: accounts[0]});


## Execute function of smart contract 




## Function Transaction 

To understand transactions, suppose there is a function in smart contract as : 

**function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) public returns(bool sufficient) {..}**

Then we can execute this function from JS as : 

**instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 10, {from: accounts[0]})**

accounts is an array of accounts. We will see later how we can access it. 

**Here if we see, sendCoin function had two arguments : address and amount**

But, our function in JS has three arguments. 

This extra argument is an object we can pass to this function to give specific details of the transaction. For example : from : "address", gas : , value :  , gasPrice : , etc. 

**Most commonly used extra parameters are : from and value (corresponding to msg.sender and msg.value)**


## Reading transaction results 

We can store the results of the transaction in an object and get various details about the transaction : 

let result = await instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 10, {from: accounts[0]})

- result.tx (string) ; Transaction hash
- result.logs (array) : Decoded events (logs)
- result.receipt (object) : Transaction receipt (includes the amount of gas used)


## Function Call

let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])

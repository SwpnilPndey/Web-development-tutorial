## Install the neccessry packages for testing

1. npm i mocha
2. npm i chai

## Add mocha test setting in truffle-config.js below the compiler object in module.exports object

 mocha: {
    timeout: 100000,
    reporter:'nyan'
  },


## Deploy the smart contract on ganache (development environment)


## Test the smart contract

1. Create a **test.js** file in test folder

2. Import the contract in JS test file as : 

const <contract name>= artifacts.require("<contract name>");

3. Import **assert** method of chai library
const { assert } = require("chai");

4. Use contract method in truffle as : 

contract("<contract name>",callback function to test functions);

5. The callback functions takes **accounts** array as parameter (ganache accounts)

6. The callback function looks like this : 

accounts=> {
   // test codes
}

7. First of all, we create our own instance of the contract using : 

accounts=> {
  let instance= null;
   before(async () => {
    instance = await <contract name>.deployed();
  });
}

8. We can use the instance of our contract in each of the tests. 

contract("<contract name>", (accounts) => {
let instance= null;
   before(async () => {
    instance = await <contract name>.deployed();
  });

// other tests will come here

});


5. Declare test cases using **it method** of mocha framework

it("Details of the test",call back function);


6. Call back function executes the contract function and checks its value using chai library (most useful method is assert)

For example we want to check whether constructor function is working correctly or not 

constructor() {
  msg.sender=owner;
}

Then the test case can be written as : 

it("Constructor function", async () => {
let _owner=accounts[0];
let contractOwner=await instance.owner();

assert.Equal(_owner,contractOwner,"Contructor function is not working");
});


7. All functions can be tested as above for its functionality


8. However, to **check the require statements** in function, we need to use try catch block to catch the exception gracefully

Here, we try to execute the function inside the try block with the parameters which violate the require condition

**One good way to handle this is to take value of any variable in the contract which is being changed by the function before the try catch and after the try catch. Both values should remain same 

For example : 

function mintAndListNFT(string memory _name) public payable {
        require(msg.value>=1000,"Kindly send required fees to mint and list NFT");
        itemCount++;
}

So, test case can be written as : 

let itemCountBefore=await instance.itemCount();

try {
  await instance.mintAndListNFT("Swapnil",{from:accounts[0], value:900})
}
catch(error) {}

let itemCountAfter=await instance.itemCount();

assert.equal(itemCountBefore, itemCountAfter, "Require statement not working");


9. **Check the events**

We know that the transaction results can be read by storing by doing a function transaction and storing in result object

let result=await instance.mintFT("Swapnil",{from:accounts[0],value:2000});

Then we can get the event logs using : 

let logs=result.logs;

### Let my contract has an event emmited as :

event MY_EVENT(address bidder, uint amount);
function bid() public payable {
        ///...
        emit MY_EVENT(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

### Check if an event with the correct name was emitted
const myEvent = logs.find(e => e.event === "MY_EVENT");
assert(myEvent, "MyEvent was not emitted");

### Check if the event contains the expected data
assert.equal(myEvent.args.myArg1, expectedValue1, "myArg1 does not match expected value");
assert.equal(myEvent.args.myArg2, expectedValue2, "myArg2 does not match expected value");

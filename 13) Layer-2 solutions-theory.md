## Arbitrum is a L2 ethereum blockchain 

It utilizes "arbitrum rollups", which performs the majority of computations off-chain, batches them together, and write the results to the Layer 1 blockchain (Ethereum).

It means lower gas fees and faster transaction confirmation times, since the blockchain only performs "proof of confirmation" if a validator node is suspicious a transaction might be fraudulent. 

### Arbitrum doesnot have a native token of its own. It uses ether and ethereum tokens. 

### So, to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens on arbitrum network, we can make use of arbitrum bridges

### Then we can deploy contract just like we deploy on Layer-1

## What is ARB ?

In March 2023, Offchain Labs announced that it would be airdropping an ERC-20 token called ARB to users who had interacted with the Arbitrum network before a certain date. The ARB token will be used for governance within the Arbitrum DAO, but it will not be used for paying transaction fees.For transactions, ETH and ERC20 tokens will continue to be used. 






## Zksync is another L2 ethereum blockchain 

It utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) to enable fast and secure transactions,and write the results to the Layer 1 blockchain (Ethereum).

### ZkSync doesnot have a native token of its own. It uses ether and ethereum tokens. 

### So, to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens on ZK Sync network, we can make use of Zk Sync bridges

### Then we can deploy contract just like we deploy on Layer-1

## Although not launched yet, ZKS is a potential token for ZK sync network just like ARB of Arbitrum





## Polygon is another L2 ethereum blockchain 

### Polygon has a native token of its own called Matic

### We can deploy contract just like we deploy on Layer-1

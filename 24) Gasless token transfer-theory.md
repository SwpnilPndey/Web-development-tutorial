## There are no free lunches in this world 

So, a gasless token transfer is not in wholly gasless. 

It just means :

1. A wants to transfer 10 tokens to B 
2. B doesnot have any ETH to do this transaction (using transferFrom)
3. C has ETH for the transaction 
4. But, C demands 1 extra token as fees to do the transaction 
5. So, effectively, A will transfer 11 tokens to C who will execute the transferFrom function to transfer 10 tokens to B and 1 token to itself 
6. Effectively for A -> B transaction, the transaction is gasless


## What is EIP 712 in this regard ?

EIP refers to Ethereum Improvement Proposal. They are proposals for improvements or changes to the Ethereum protocol itself. 

It is **different from ERC** (Ethereum Request for Comments). ERCs define specific rules and guidelines for tokens or other functionalities on the Ethereum blockchain.

**EIP 712** enables the definition of structured data with a specific type. This is useful when dealing with complex data structures, such as nested objects or arrays.

It means that different messages can have different types and meanings, even if they have the same byte representation. This is achieved through the inclusion of a domain separator, which is a unique identifier associated with each message type. The domain separator ensures that messages with different types are treated as distinct and separate entities.



## This is the simple explanation of GASLESS TOKEN TRANSFER.
